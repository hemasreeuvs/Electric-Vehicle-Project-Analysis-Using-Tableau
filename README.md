# Data-Analysis_-Electric-Vehicle-Project

**Problem Statement**
*KPI Requirement*

1. Total Vehicles
   
   >> Understand the overall landsacpe of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs , to assess the markest size and growth

2. Average Electric Range:

   >> Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to guage the technological advanacements and efficiency of EVs

3. Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:

    >> Identify and analyze the total number of Batter Electric Vehicles(BEVs) in the data set.
    
    >> Calcualte the % of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insinghts into the dominance of fully electric models.
    
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:

    >> Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles(PHEV) in the data set.
    
    >> Calcualte the % of PHEV relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insinghts into the dominance of fully electric models.
